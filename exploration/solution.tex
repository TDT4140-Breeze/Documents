\subsection{Deliverables}
\subsubsection{Software}
A functional roBOT, able to connect end users together in a chat room and interact with them based on the users' input. The roBOT will also gather all of the users' input as a chat log, which will be automatically sent to the lecturer and/or saved by the students.

\subsubsection{Infrastructure}
We are aiming for a web-based solution that will be able to run in both browser and on smartphones, although the smartphone solution is not highly prioritized.

\subsection{Way of working}
We will use git for version control of active development. For project related communication we will be using gitter, which is directly connected to github, although we also have a Facebook-chat for other communication. Our git repository can be found on github \fnurl{here}{https://github.com/sindrehan/TDT4140-Project}.

Quality assurance will be done as we go, trying to work in pairs as much as possible. This way we get a wider knowledge of the project as a whole. As the project goes on we will write tests as we discover what needs to be tested.
