\section {Executive Summary}
We wanted a way for lectures to fill time when something needs fixing, or to encourage discussion after a lecture. We set out to make an app that would scale well, with the possibility to make infinitely large lobbies, though it is not advised to do so, as it would be a heavy strain on the server. We divided into two groups, one working on front-end, the other back-end. Our app lets lecturers gather students in a lobby, and place them into fitting chat rooms where they can discuss a topic given by the lecturer.
